 I'm sorry,for everything that I've done. Sometimes you must be know life is a alone way, always is.
 Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame. Where there is a flame, someone’s bound to get burned. But just because it burns, doesn’t mean you’re gonna die, 
you’ve gotta get up and try try try.Love you like I would. Maybe that's a fate.
